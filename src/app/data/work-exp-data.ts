Came up with the solution of injecting JavaScript into bespoke html components that the platform allows to be added onto the portal UI. This has opened up what can be promised and charged to clients, improved client rentention and as a result improved revenue streams to the organisation as a whole.",

The CSS contained many redundant rules and was very unpredictable, making brand styling extremely laborious. Improved the teams styling workflow by learning basic SCSS, rewriting the stylesheet into SCSS files and subsequently getting team members familiar with the technology.",
